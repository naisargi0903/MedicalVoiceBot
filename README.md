# **Multimodal Medical Chatbot for Virtual Healthcare Assistance**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a **Multimodal Medical Chatbot** that provides accurate and efficient responses to medical queries using a **Multimodal Large Language Model (LLM)**. The chatbot supports **vision and voice inputs**, improving accessibility and usability for diverse patient populations.

## **Dataset**
This project uses the DermNet dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamgoel27/dermnet
The DermNet dataset contains dermatological images across various skin conditions, making it suitable for training models to recognize and classify skin disorders.


## **Objectives**
1. Deliver **precise medical responses** using an advanced **Multimodal LLM**.
2. Facilitate **interactions via text, speech, and images** for comprehensive virtual assistance.
3. Enhance **accessibility** for visually or hearing-impaired users.
4. Integrate **state-of-the-art AI** for advanced medical support.

## **Key Features**
- **Real-time Medical Insights**: AI-driven analysis of medical queries, images, and symptoms.
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Uses **OpenAI Whisper** for accurate transcription of patient speech.
- **Medical Image Analysis**: Leverages **LLaMA 3 Vision** for image-based diagnostics.
- **Conversational AI with Voice Output**: Generates **doctor-like responses** using **Text-to-Speech (TTS) models**.
- **Multilingual Support**: Provides assistance in multiple languages for global accessibility.

## **Architecture & Approach**
The system integrates:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for understanding medical queries.
- **Multimodal Integration** combining **text, voice, and images**.
- **Deep Learning Models** like **Transformers (BERT, GPT, etc.)** for chatbot responses.
- **Medical Knowledge Graphs** for structured knowledge representation.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Gradio** – UI for user interactions.
- **Groq** – Model acceleration.
- **ElevenLabs** – Advanced TTS for realistic doctor-like responses.
- **Google Text-to-Speech** – Backup TTS service.
- **OpenAI Whisper** – Speech-to-text conversion.

## **Innovations**
 **Automated Medical Image Diagnosis** for AI-powered analysis.  
 **Scalable Decision Tree** for structured medical advice.  
 **Faster Response Times** using AI-driven lookups.  
 **Multilingual Support** for global accessibility.  

## **Conclusion**
The **Multimodal Medical Chatbot** revolutionizes **virtual healthcare assistance** by integrating speech, text, and medical image analysis. With **real-time transcription, AI-powered diagnostics, and natural language interactions**, it enhances **efficiency, accessibility, and accuracy** in healthcare consultations.
